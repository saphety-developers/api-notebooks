# Overview
Issuing invoices in accordance with all **legal requirements** and ensuring delivery to the costumers, is something that should be done using each companyâ€™s billing system.
This document is a technical guide how to implement an integration between any software and **Saphety Invoice Network Portal**, thus bringing the power of this **API** directly into your billing system.

## Audience
This document is intended for **developers** that want to automate issuing invoices from any system using **Saphety Invoice Network Portal**.
After reading this book you should be able to fully automate any system integration with **Saphety Invoice Network Portal**.

So, if you are a developer of your own software, a developer for a software-house or a developer for an ERP, **the first step to start** testing the API is to **register** at **API-SANDBOX Portal** to get your own credentials (username and password) to generate a valid token to test the API.

With these credentials you are able to test the API, simulating the scenarios as if you were in a Production environment.

Through **API-SANDBOX Portal**, you can have access to:
* test API services
* access to API documentation
* request support by subscribing to a plan (not yet, but to be announced soon)
* request partnership agreements by subscribing to a plan (not yet, but to be announced soon)

To register on the **API-SANDBOX Portal** access here: [here](https://dcn-solution.saphety.com/Dcn.Sandbox.Client/public)

After you finish developing and testing the API, the next step will be to register in Production the issuing entity that will use the API services. This entity must register in Saphety Invoice Network (SIN) portal and has to subscribe a plan that best suits his needs. 

To register on the **Saphety Invoice Network Portal** access here: [here](https://www.saphety.com/)

The credentials obtained in this registration (user and password) will be the ones you must be used to generate a valid token for API services in the Production environment.
