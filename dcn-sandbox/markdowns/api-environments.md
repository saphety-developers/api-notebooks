# API Environments
The **Saphety Invoice Network API** is connected to two environments:
* Test (Sandbox)
* Production

## Test environment
The first step to start testing the API is to register at **API-SANDBOX Portal** to get your own credentials (username and password) to generate a valid token to test the API in test environment.

With these credentials you are able to test the API, simulating the scenarios as if you were in a Production environment.

Through **API-SANDBOX Portal**, you can have access to:
* test API services
* access to API documentation
* request support by subscribing to a plan (not yet, but to be announced soon)
* request partnership agreements by subscribing to a plan (not yet, but to be announced soon)

To register on the **API-SANDBOX Portal** access here: [here](https://dcn-solution.saphety.com/Dcn.Sandbox.Client/public)


## Production environment
After you have finished developing and testing the **API**, the next step will be to register the issuing company at **Saphety Invoice Network** in **Production** environment. 

The registration must be done by the issuing entity that will use the **API** services. This entity must be registered and must subscribe a plan to start send documents.

To register on the **Saphety Invoice Network API** access here: [here](https://www.saphety.com/)

The credentials obtained in this registration (user and password) will be the ones you must use to generate a valid token for **API** services in the **Production** environment.
