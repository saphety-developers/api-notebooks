## Legal Framework
**Electronic invoices**  
In Portugal, the obligation to send electronic invoices for public entities is regulated by **Law-decree no. 123/2018, of December 28**, which was transposed into national legislation by **Directive 2014/55/EU** of the **European Parliament and of the Council**, relating electronic invoicing in public contracts.

This obligation applies to large companies from **January 1st/2021**, and for small, medium and micro companies from **January 1st/2024**.

Technical specifications for UBL2.1 CIUS-PT XML format was defined by eSPap and they are published here: [eSPap - SPFin - Fatura Eletr√≥nica ](https://www.espap.gov.pt/FrontEnd/Paginas/Areas/SP_Fin/SP_Fin_NormasFEAP_tpl_1.aspx)  

**PDF invoices**
From **January 1st/2024**, sending invoices in PDF format, must be done using the authentication of documents through a **Qualified Digital Certificate**, otherwise, they cease to have legal validity.

To ensure compliance with this legal obligation (**Law-decree no. 28/2029**), Sovos/Saphety provides electronic signature service with a qualified certificate, which will ensure the authentication of all PDF invoices sent by your company.
