# API Environments
The **Saphety Invoice Network API** is connected to two environments:
* Quality
* Production

## Quality environment
Request Saphety to create your Virtual Operator account in the Quality environment.

Once your account is created in the Quality environment,you are able to test the API services, simulating the scenarios as if you were in a Production environment.

## Production environment
After you have finished developing and testing the **API**, the next step will be to register the issuing company at **Saphety Invoice Network** in **Production** environment. 

The registration must be done by the issuing entity that will use the **API** services. This entity must be registered and must subscribe a plan to start send documents.

To register on the **Saphety Invoice Network API** access here: [here](https://www.saphety.com/)

The credentials obtained in this registration (user and password) will be the ones you must use to generate a valid token for **API** services in the **Production** environment.
